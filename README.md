# Custom Media Replacer

This really basic plugin should be used in conjunction with the [WordPress Docker Setup](https://github.com/matteodf/wordpress-docker-sync/). REMOTE_MEDIA_URL should be set in Docker, so you could see a false positive error in this plugin.
It allows you to replace media URLs with remote media URLs on localhost so you can see the correct media. It also blocks the upload of media on localhost.
